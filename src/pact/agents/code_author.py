You are implementing a component against its contract. The contract defines
WHAT to build, the tests define HOW to verify. Produce an implementation
that passes all contract tests.

All type, function, and error class names must match the contract stub exactly.
Check the REQUIRED EXPORTS list at the bottom of the stub — tests import these
names directly. Standalone functions are module-level, not class methods.
Enum member names match variant names exactly (no UPPERCASE conversion).
All log statements include the PACT log key. If using Pydantic, use v2 API
(model_validator, field_validator, model_dump, ConfigDict).

When the contract defines types with validators, implement them as canonical data
structures with runtime validation (Pydantic models, dataclasses with __post_init__
checks, or equivalent). Invalid inputs should raise clear errors. Prefer bespoke
types over raw primitives for fields with domain semantics.

Every class must accept optional event_handler and log_handler kwargs:
  def __init__(self, ..., event_handler=None, log_handler=None):
      self._emit = event_handler or (lambda event: None)
      self._log = log_handler or (lambda level, msg, ctx: None)
Call self._emit() at start and end of every public method with:
  {"pact_key": "PACT:<component_id>:<method_name>", "event": "invoked"|"completed",
   "input_classification": [...], "output_classification": [...],
   "side_effects": [...], "ts": time.time_ns()}

emission must be a silent no-op — no stdout, no errors."""

Check the REQUIRED EXPORTS list — tests import these names directly.
Standalone functions are pub module-level functions. All log statements
include the PACT log key via the pact_log! macro.

Write idiomatic Rust with proper ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
Use Result<T, E> for all fallible operations — never unwrap() or panic!()
in library code. Prefer &str over String for function inputs; return String
for owned values. Use Option<T> for optional fields and parameters.

Use serde (Serialize, Deserialize) for all data types that cross boundaries.
Use thiserror::Error for custom error types — derive Error with #[error("...")]
messages. Use anyhow::Result only in binary entry points, not library code.

Include all necessary `use` statements at the top of each module. Prefer
explicit imports over glob imports. Common patterns:
  use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
  use thiserror::Error;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

When the contract defines types with validators, implement validation in
constructor functions (e.g., fn new(...) -> Result<Self, Error>) or use the
builder pattern. Invalid inputs should return Err, not panic.

Struct fields that have domain semantics should use newtype wrappers
(e.g., pub struct UserId(pub String)) rather than raw primitives.

Every public struct must derive Debug and Clone at minimum. Data structs
should also derive Serialize and Deserialize. Error enums should derive
Error (thiserror) and Debug.

All log statements must use the pact_log! macro with the embedded PACT key
for production traceability. When no log handler is configured, logging must
be a silent no-op — no stdout, no errors."""

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep the same overall structure and architecture
- Keep all type names, class names, and function names EXACTLY as they are
- Only modify the specific logic that causes the listed test failures
- Do NOT rename anything — the REQUIRED EXPORTS must remain unchanged
- If a test fails due to edge case handling, add the edge case handling
- If a test fails due to incorrect computation, fix the computation
